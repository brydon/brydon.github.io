                    Broadly, my research interests involve computational biology and general mathematical modelling of biological processes, systems, and phenomena. In particular, I am currently interested in applying machine learning/artificial intellgience technqiues in tandem with differential equations and stochastic models to answer questions of cancer stem cell evolution and treatment response in the study of human cancers. I find biological systems to be fascinating in their complexity and hope to elucidate their behaviour by using stochastic machine learning techniques coupled with traditional models. After all, nature has <a href="https://xkcd.com/1605/" title="Relevant XKCD">no compunction to regulate towards easy description</a> even if it does so in aggregate.

                                    <div class="card card-body">Biological models of predator-prey interaction have been shown to have high sensitivity to the functional form of the predator response (see [3]). Chemostat models with competition have been shown to be robust under various forms of response function (see [15]). The focus here is restricted to a simple chemostat model with predator-prey dynamics. Several functional responses of Holling Type II form are considered. The sensitivity of dynamics to our choice of functional form is demonstrated by way of bifurcation theory. These results should be a warning to modelers, since by data collection and curve-fitting alone it is impossible to determine the exact functional form of the predator response function.

                                    <div class="card card-body">The in-silico development of a chemotherapeutic dosing schedule for treating cancer relies upon a parameterization of a particular tumour growth model to describe the dynamics of the cancer in response to the dose of the drug. In practice, it is often prohibitively difficult to ensure the validity of patient-specific parameterizations of these models for any particular patient. As a result, sensitivities to these particular parameters can result in therapeutic dosing schedules that are optimal in principle not performing well on particular patients. In this study, we demonstrate that chemotherapeutic dosing strategies learned via reinforcement learning methods are more robust to perturbations in patient-specific parameter values than those learned via classical optimal control methods. By training a reinforcement learning agent on mean-value parameters and allowing the agent periodic access to a more easily measurable metric, relative bone marrow density, for the purpose of optimizing dose schedule while reducing drug toxicity, we are able to develop drug dosing schedules that outperform schedules learned via classical optimal control methods, even when such methods are allowed to leverage the same bone marrow measurements.

                                    <div class="card card-body">The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since spread quickly around the world. To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections. Importantly, the effective reproduction number, and thus the course of the pandemic, is found to be sensitive to the adherence to public health policies, illustrating the need for vigilance as the economy continues to reopen.

It is proved that local asymptotic stability of the coexistence equilibrium implies that it is globally asymptotically stable. It is also shown that when the coexistence equilibrium exists, but is unstable, solutions converge to a unique, orbitally asymptotically stable periodic orbit. Thus the range of the dynamics of the chemostat predator-prey model is the same as for the analogous classical Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model with Holling Type II functional response. An extension that applies to other functional responses is also given.

                                    <div class="card card-body">The cancer stem cell hypothesis claims that tumor growth and progression are driven by a (typically) small niche of the total cancer cell population called cancer stem cells (CSCs). These CSCs can go through symmetric or asymmetric divisions to differentiate into specialised, progenitor cells or reproduce new CSCs. While it was once held that this differentiation pathway was unidirectional, recent research has demonstrated that differentiated cells are more plastic than initially considered. In particular, differentiated cells can de-differentiate and recover their stem-like capacity. Two recent papers have considered how this rate of plasticity affects the evolutionary dynamic of an invasive, malignant population of stem cells and differentiated cells into existing tissue (Mahdipour-Shirayeh et al., 2017; Wodarz, 2018). These papers arrive at seemingly opposing conclusions, one claiming that increased plasticity results in increased invasive potential, and the other that increased plasticity decreases invasive potential. Here, we show that what is most important, when determining the effect on invasive potential, is how one distributes this increased plasticity between the compartments of resident and mutant-type cells. We also demonstrate how these results vary, producing non-monotone fixation probability curves, as inter-compartmental plasticity changes when differentiated cell compartments are allowed to continue proliferating, highlighting a fundamental difference between the two models. We conclude by demonstrating the stability of these qualitative results over various parameter ranges. Keywords: cancer stem cells, plasticity, de-differentiation, fixation probability.

When combined with other complementary techniques such as diffraction and quantum chemical calculations – an approach referred to as NMR crystallography – powerful structure determination strategies emerge that allow for the elucidation of detailed structures that no one technique could provide on its own. We have been particularly interested in developing structure solution strategies that maximally exploit the structural information available in 1D and 2D solid state NMR data from network materials such as zeolites, with a view to being able to solve structures when minimal diffraction data is available, such as disordered layered structures. Based on some elegant mathematics in the area of combinatorial tiling theory, we are developing a novel structure solution strategy for network materials that will efficiently generate all feasible structures that arise from the number of sites (number of peaks), relative site occupancies (peak intensities), coordination environments (chemical shifts) revealed in 1D solid-state NMR spectra and the inter-site connectivities (cross peak intensities) revealed in 2D correlation spectra. One of the key features of this approach is that no prior knowledge of the crystallographic space group or unit cell parameters is intrinsically necessary, which in principle allows for the generation of network crystal structures directly from solid-state NMR data alone. This talk will introduce and explain Delaney symbols (mathematical structures for describing tilings of the 2D plane or 3D space), highlighting the rich amount of structural information that they contain and how they allow for novel conceptual linkages between solid-state NMR and crystallography of network materials.

We determine all the minimal spectrally arbitrary patterns of order 2 and 3. Finally, we demonstrate that there exist spectrally arbitrary patterns for which the nilpotent-Jacobian method fails.

In 2003, Fiedler introduced a larger class of companion matrices that includes the Frobenius companion matrices. One property of the combinatorial pattern of these companion matrices is that, up to diagonal similarity, they uniquely realize every possible spectrum of a real matrix. We characterize matrix patterns that have this property and consequently introduce more companion matrix patterns. We observe that each Fiedler companion matrix is permutationally similar to a unit Hessenberg matrix. We provide digraph characterizations of the classes of patterns described, and in particular, all sparse companion matrices, noting that there are companion matrices that are not sparse.
